- 👋 Hi, I’m @RiptCodes
- 👀 I’m interested in improving in my coding abilities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, html, css and SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to improve on advance code to help me on all languages.
- 📫 Reach me by discord, Riptz#5861
- 

- This code describes me and I would like to come back to this in a few years to add the code I have learned. Something I can say at the age of 16 is that I am very behind on my code and I am willing to do whatever I can to make my code better. Tuitions would help <3 If you have a community for me on discord or any socials then just tell me bcause I would like to imrpove fast. 
Future me, hope you got into your dream uni :)
